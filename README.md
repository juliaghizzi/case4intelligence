Hello!
How are you?

This repository contains the are R scripts I have wrote to produce tables, figures and forecasts for the Data Analysis Skill Test of 4intelligence company.
The R scripts are named in reference to the case they produce information to solve. If one wants to run the code, please change 'direc_input' to the directory path where the data is stored and change 'direc_output' to the directory path where one wishes to save Latex tables and figures.
The report is also in this repository under the name "Case Report - JÃºlia Ghizzi".

I should warn you that I could not finish the entire case.

Thank you for the opportunity!
